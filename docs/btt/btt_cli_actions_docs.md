# BTT Predefined Action Types (Quick Reference)

This file is a placeholder. Action type IDs (`BTTPredefinedActionType`) are used in trigger JSON but BTT does not publish a complete public list. Common ones discovered through use:

| ID | Action |
|---|---|
| 2 | Move to Next Desktop |
| 45 | No Action (placeholder) |
| 49 | Launch Application (`BTTLaunchPath` required) |
| 153 | Run Shell Script |
| 172 | Show Notification (`BTTNotificationText`, `BTTNotificationDetails`) |

Discover more by exporting existing BTT presets as JSON and inspecting `BTTPredefinedActionType` values.
